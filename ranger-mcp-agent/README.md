# Ranger MCP Agent Examples

This folder demonstrates how to build AI agents that interact with the [Ranger Perps MCP Server](../ranger_perps_mcp/README.md) using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) and the [`mcp-agent`](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent) framework.

## What can you build with `ranger_perps_mcp`?

- **Automated Trading Agents:**
  - Fetch real-time market data, get trade quotes, and prepare transactions for perpetuals trading on Solana.
  - Use SOR tools to generate and manage trading transactions (increase, decrease, close positions, withdraw, etc.).
- **Portfolio Management Bots:**
  - Query open positions, trade history, and liquidation data for a given account.
  - Build dashboards or notification systems for portfolio health and risk.
- **LLM-Driven Workflows:**
  - Integrate with LLMs (like Claude, GPT-4, etc.) to create conversational trading assistants.
  - Use agent patterns (orchestrator, planner-evaluator, human-in-the-loop) to automate or semi-automate trading workflows.

## Example Agents

This folder contains example agents that demonstrate:

- Connecting to the Ranger MCP server as an MCP client
- Calling tools such as `sor_get_trade_quote` and `data_get_positions`
- Composing multi-step workflows using the [`mcp-agent`](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent) framework

See the `examples/` subfolder for runnable agent scripts and workflow patterns.

## Demo Trading Strategies ðŸ’²

Below are example LLM-driven trading workflows you can build using the Ranger Perps MCP server and agent patterns:

---

### 1. Mean Reversion Trading

- **Monitor liquidation volumes** using `data_get_latest_liquidations` and related tools
- **Calculate statistical deviations (Z-score):**
  - Identify unusual market liquidations that often lead to trading opportunities
  - Use LLMs or Python code to compute Z-scores on liquidation data
- **Execute trades during market capitulation events:**
  - Trigger SOR tools (e.g., `sor_get_trade_quote`, `sor_increase_position`) when signals are detected

### 2. Funding Rate Arbitrage

- **Exploit funding rate differentials between venues:**
  - Use tools like `data_get_funding_arbs` and `data_get_oi_weighted_funding_rate`
- **Automated spread capture:**
  - LLM/agent logic can monitor and act on funding rate spreads
- **Risk-managed position execution:**
  - Combine with position monitoring and liquidation data for safer trades

### 3. Data-Driven Signals

Key metrics available via MCP tools:

- **Daily Summary:**
  - Compile your own account summaries using `data_get_positions`, `data_get_trade_history`
- **OI Weighted Funding Rate analysis:**
  - Assess market bias and spot potential reversals
- **Open Interest tracking:**
  - Use OI data to monitor market participation and crowding
- **Trade history & Position monitoring:**
  - Build dashboards or alerting agents for your portfolio

These strategies can be implemented as LLM-driven agents, using the example patterns and tools provided in this repo.
